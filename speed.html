<h1>Speed Mechanics</h1>
This page describes the mechanics of speed in Tibia 7.4.<br>
<h2>Base speed</h2>
The base speed formula is as follows:<br><br>
&emsp;<em>BaseSpeed = 218 + (Level * 2)</em><br><br>

<h2>Speed modifying items</h2>

Boots of haste (BoH) increase speed by 40 (equivalent to 20 levels).<br><br>

<img src="/images/time_ring.GIF" alt="Time Ring" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Time rings increase speed by 60 (equivalent to 30 levels). Time rings lasts for 10 minutes.<br><br>
  
<img src="/images/winged_helmet.PNG" alt="Winged Helmet" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Winged helmets increase speed by 40, but are extremely rare.<br>

<h2>Haste</h2>
  Haste (Utani Hur) costs 60 mana for increases speed for 66 seconds as follows:<br><br>
  &emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = (BaseSpeed * 1.3) - 24</em><br><br>
    
  Strong Haste (Utani Gran Hur) costs 100 mana and increases speed for 44 seconds as follows:<br><br>
  &emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = (BaseSpeed * 1.7) - 56</em><br><br>
    
Then resulting value is rounded down (to be confirmed). The negative speed modifier reduces the effect of haste spells, but this effect reduces at higher levels. A lv 11, 100 and 200 will have a 20, 24 and 29% increase in speed from haste and 47, 56 and 61% from strong haste respectively. <br>

<h2>Speed formula and breakpoints</h2>
&emsp;<em>TotalSpeed = ModifiedSpeed + ItemModifier</em><br><br>

&emsp;<em>StepTime = roundup(TerrainFactor / TotalSpeed * DiagonalFactor, 0.05)</em><br><br>
  
The time for each step, in seconds, is speed divided by the terrain factor, then rounded to the nearest 50 milliseconds. The rounding can have a significant impact on speed causing noticable jumps at certain 'breakpoints'. The higher the speed, the more spreadout but impactful these breakpoints become.<br><br> 
Taken to the extreme a level 300 player using strong haste, BoH and a time ring will have a speed of 1434, on a fast terrain this would be a step time of 100/1434 = roundup(0.0697,0.05) = 0.010. This is a 43% less than expected.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>DiagonalFactor = 3 for diagonal or 1 for orthogonal</em><br><br>

Using Pythagoras a diagonal step should take 1.41x longer than an orthogonal one, but instead it takes 3x! This is not an efficient way to move except to avoid fire fields and in PvP. Speed appears to be related to tile you are moving to. When you move a step from the game's perspective you are immediately on the new tile and then need to wait the step duration for the next action.<br> 
<h2>Terrain</h2>
Grass, ice, mud<br>

<h2>Paralyze</h2>
<img src="/images/paralyze_rune.GIF" alt="Paralyze Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

The Paralyze rune is exclusive to Druids with premium and costs 600 mana to make and a further 600 to use (for real 7.4 Tibia it was 900 mana). It sets speed to 40, cancelling haste and overriding base speed so target level makes no difference. Using a healing spell or rune or the haste spell will remove the paralyzed status, although the current step will need to be completed at paralyzed speed. From the games perspective when you take a step your position is immediately the new tile, and the animation relflects the delay before your next step. Because speed modifing items are not affected by paralysis they can significantly increase speed while paralyzed.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = 40</em><br><br>
  
 During a step you cannot use runes or equip items like energy rings although instant spells can be used (the use of multiple instant spells while paralysed is to be confirmed). Due to its huge cost and limited effect, the Paralyze rune is not valuable in PvE. In PvP it can be very powerful by allowing time to surround and trap a target even if they are in the open, or to prevent rune healing and kill while the target completes a step - this is more effective against knights who don't get exura vita. Casting paralyze then immediately pushing the target in a diagonal step on a slow tile will maximise the duration. A diagonal step on the slowest tile can take as long as 15 seconds to complete under paralysis.

<h2>Creature speed</h2>
  
Giant Spiders with haste have a max speed of 391. Monster haste has some degee of variance, for example Giant spiders are 60-70% boosted. On a grass tile this rounds down to 375 needed to match their speed (breakpoint 8). This is comparable to level 59 with BoH.<br>
To outrun an Orc Berserker with haste you need 364 speed which is level 53 with BoH.<br>
To outrun a Behemoth with haste you need 420 speed which is level 81 with BoH.<br><br>

Most other monsters which don't cast haste have a relatively slow speed. The relatively fast Black Knight has a speed of a 305, equivalent to lv 44 without BoH. For information on creature speeds see the creature page.<br><br>

<h2>Creature paralysis</h2>

Most creatures that can paralyse can reduce your speed in a range up to 100% of your base speed (speed is limited to a minimum of 40). As with the Paralyze rune, BoH and time rings can help to significantly increase minimum movement speed.<br><br>
  
Creatures that cause paralysis include mummies, vampires, banshees, elder beholders and ancient scarabs.<br><br>
