<h1>Speed</h1>
This page describes the mechanics of speed in Tibia 7.4.<br>
<h2>Base speed</h2>
The base speed formula is as follows:<br><br>
&emsp;<em>BaseSpeed = 218 + (Level * 2)</em><br><br>

<h2>Speed modifying items</h2>

Boots of haste increase speed by 40 (equivalent to 20 levels).<br><br>

<img src="/images/time_ring.GIF" alt="Time Ring" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Time rings increase speed by 60 (equivalent to 30 levels). Time rings lasts for 10 minutes.<br><br>
  
<img src="/images/winged_helmet.GIF" alt="Winged Helmet" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Winged helmets increase speed by 40, but are extremely rare.<br>

<h2>Haste</h2>
  Haste (Utani Hur) increases speed as follows:<br><br>
  &emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = (BaseSpeed * 1.3) - 24</em><br><br>
    
  Strong Haste (Utani Gran Hur) increases speed as follows:<br><br>
  &emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = (BaseSpeed * 1.7) - 56</em><br><br>
    
Then resulting value is rounded down (to be confirmed).<br>
<h2>Paralyze</h2>
<img src="/images/paralyze_rune.GIF" alt="Paralyze Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

The Paralyze rune is exclusive to Druids with premium and costs 600 mana to make and a further 600 to use (for real 7.4 Tibia it was 900 mana). It sets speed to 40, cancelling haste and overriding base speed so target level makes no difference. Using a healing spell or rune or the haste spell will remove the paralyzed status, although the current step will need to be completed at paralyzed speed. Because speed modifing items are not affected by paralysis they can significantly increase speed while paralysed.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>ModifiedSpeed = 40</em><br><br>
  
A diagonal step on the slowest tile can take as long as 15 seconds to complete under paralysis. During a step you cannot use runes although instant spells can be used.<br>
<h2>Speed formula and breakpoints</h2>
&emsp;<em>TotalSpeed = ModifiedSpeed + ItemModifier</em><br><br>

&emsp;<em>StepTime = roundup(TerrainFactor / TotalSpeed, 0.05)</em><br><br>
  
The time for each step, in seconds, is speed divided by the terrain factor, then rounded to the nearest 50 milliseconds. The rounding can have a significant impact on speed causing noticable jumps at certain 'breakpoints'. The higher the speed, the more spreadout but impactful these breakpoints become.<br><br> 
Taken to the extreme a level 300 player using strong haste, BoH and a time ring will have a speed of 1434, on a fast terrain this would be a step time of 100/1434 = roundup(0.0697,0.05) = 0.010. This is a 43% less than expected.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>DiagonalStepTime = 3 * step time</em><br><br>

Using Pythagoras a digonal step should take 1.41x longer than an orthogonal one, but instead it takes 3x! This is not an efficient way to move except to avoid fire fields and in PvP. Speed appears to be related to tile you are moving to. When you move a step from the game's perspective you are immediately on the new tile and then need to wait the step duration for the next action.<br>
