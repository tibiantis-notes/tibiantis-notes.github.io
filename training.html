<h1>Training Guide</h1>

It takes 216 hours to train to 80 skill in perfect conditions, but might take another 50 hours if you only trained at 80% efficiency.<br><br>

This guide aims to help you improve your training efficiency and convenience.<br><br>

<h2>Calculating efficiency</h2>

Players training melee need to deal at least one blood hit every 30 attempted hit or attempted block before they stop gaining skill experience.<br><br>

Attacking with a  
shield equipped and two creatures attacking you will mean in 10 turns you will have 10 hits and 20 blocks, if you don't make a blood hit within these 10 turns you will stop progressing weapon and shielding skill. Remember you dont need to take damage to train shielding! If you block more than 2 creatures your shielding will be broken and the additional creatures will ignore your shielding for extra damage, but thankfully as a result it doesn't use your allowance.<br><br>

Similarly if you block one creature you will need to hit within 15 turns, and shielding progresses half as fast. If you dont wear a shield at all, your weapon defence will be used to block up to two creatures, but helpfully blocking with a weapon doesn't use your blocking allowance and you would only need a hit within 30 turns to maintain progression, but would not progress shielding at all!<br><br>

You can calculate efficiency by working out the chance the previous <em>n</em> hits were a miss, where <em>n</em> is the 10, 15 or 30 hits discussed before.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>efficiency = 1 &minus; miss_chance <sup>n</sup>
</em><br><br>


&emsp;<em>efficiency = 1 &minus; (1 &minus; hit_chance) <sup>n</sup>
</em><br><br>


<h2>Table: Training efficiency from hit chance</h2>
Use this table to estimate your efficiency based on chance to hit while blocking 0, 1 or 2 monsters. 1/ chance represents the average turns between blood hits.<br><br>

<h2>General Guidance</h2>

Each skill level takes 10% longer than the previous level and, strangely, is equal to 10% of the entire experience gained before it. This makes it easy to work out how much you will loose on death: 10x the overall percent lost, so 2% becomes 20% of a skill level. A player training at 100% efficiency will have roughly 2.5 more skill levels than at 80%.<br><br>

Against non-self healing monsters, training is a balance between efficiency and longevity of the monster, and this compromise often prevents players hitting 100% efficiency. There is no single best way to train, a range of options will be provided from high longevity to high efficiency.<br><br>

For an training times to different skill levels see the <a href="Skills">skills</a>  page.<br><br>

<strong>Max damage</strong> combines the weapon atk, skill and stance into one convenient number. Use the calculator to work out your max damage.<br><br>

<strong>Average damage</strong> is relevant for healing mons, and kill time shows how often monsters would need to be refreshed.<br><br>

<strong>Max AFK efficiency</strong> refers to maximising the amount of skill experience that can be gained while afk until log out, on non healing monsters. This is achieved by by reducing your max attack until your kill time is around 15 minutes, or 14 so you don&apos;t log back in with a red hp monster. Your efficiency will drop but efficiency skill experience gained will be maximised.<br><br>

<strong>Higher HP monsters</strong> allow you to train for longer before refreshing but when they have higher defences and armor they you will need higher damage to maintain efficiency so your average hit will be for more damage - reducing the benefit of higher HP. Some monsters spawn with armor and this can significantly reduce your efficiency.<br><br>

<strong>Physical damage projectiles</strong> such as the Dwarf Soldier's bolt are blocked by shielding in the same way as melee attacks. This reduces their damage (good against hunters), and progresses your skill but also takes up some of your blocking limit. If you are blocking two orc warriors and there is an orc spearman in the background the spearman's spear will bypass your shielding. Similarly if you are blocking two Valkyries and one throws a spear it will bypass your shielding. If you only block one Valkyrie it may be able to do a melee attack and a spear in the same turn but your shielding won't be broken. These monsters are often only suitable to train on if you only block one.<br><br>

Look for opportunities to skill outside of proper training. It doesn't need to be efficient if the altentative is nothing!<br><br>
Examples include:<ul>
<li>Skilling on weaker mobs while waiting for a spawn or respawn, e.g. monks by demons spawns.
<li>Switching to balanced or defence mode in hunting spots that do not respawn fast enough.
<li>PvP skilling while team hunting.
<li>Blocking additional monsters when armor is high enough.
<li>AFK training on cyclops when you need to leave during a hunt at Cyclopolis.
<li>Attacking on defence mode while blocking for a shooter which provides some efficiency even against the strongest monsters.
<li> On the weakest monsters you may not be able to train weapon skill but you can still train shielding by attacking every 30 seconds.
<li>Remember mage shield training is very effective.</ul>


<h2>Weapon Choice</h2>
Using a variety of weapons and stances can give some flexibility over your max damage, but there are some limits.<br><br>

Your minimum damage is defence mode with a <strong>knife</strong>, <strong>sickle</strong> or <strong>crowbar</strong> - club users get a good advantage for having 6 atk crowbar. This minimum can be too high for some monsters as your skill grows.<br><br>

Sword users often don't train shield since the Giant Sword, Sword of Valour have great defence, by skipping a shield they can train more efficiently and get higher skills than axe + shield, further boosted when hunting (since often you are only hit by only one mob so shielding rises slower). In the past few knew this and sword players often trained using shields - to their detriment. The problem with dropping a shield is that some monsters attacks are too strong to block with a weak weapon, in these cases a middle ground of blocking one monster can be used. Bright sword, two handed sword, broad sword and staff all have good defence.<br><br>

Weapons on defensive mode have 60% their atk value, rounded up. This means that 7 atk <strong>and</strong> 8 atk weapons become 4.2 and 4.8 rounded up to 5. You aren't limited to the knife and can instead use dagger, combat knife or silver dagger. The extra 2 defence of the silver dagger is appreciated if not wearing a shield.  <br><br>

An ideal monster (non healing) should have high HP and low defence, but not so low you kill too quickly on minimum damage.<br><br>

If you are a club user you probrably will want to train shield. Those that dont - PvP warhammer, thunder hammer, or just want to maximise hammer of wrath/ heavy mace damage will have powerful options for training as crowbar and no shield is one of the best option available - staff also is great for its 25 defence and low attack.<br><br>


Different efficiencies at different chance to hit and shielding.<br><br>

<h2>Creature Guidance</h2>
										
<h3>Ghouls - general</h3>
Ghouls have an average healing of 12 hp every 16 seconds giving a total healing of 0.75 hp per second.
 <h3>Summoned Ghoul</h3>
Summoned ghouls use defensive mode. A max damage of 38 (23a:24s:b) provides 96/80.2/66.1% efficiency and average damage of 0.72 (0.36 per second), well within healing range.<br><br>

A max damage of 45 (26a:25s:b) has 99.3/91.4/80.4% efficiency and 0.66 damage per second, this may be most suitable for knights who don’t need to train shielding.<br><br>

Not for non-pvp as you cant attack summons!<br><br>

<h3>Spawned Ghoul</h3>
Vs a spawned ghoul, i.e on balanced mode, a max damage of 33 (20a:24s:b) has 99.9/ 97.3/90.9% efficiency and deals 0.685hp/ second. Over 1 hour a ghoul would do 4000 damage in life drain damage. A garlic necklace would save about 600 damage each. A lv 42 or below elite knight heals 900hp and 300 x 20/25 = 1140hp/hr. Therefore you would need rune healing for 2860 hp per hour. This is equivalent to 11 UH or 1.75k/hr. How much physical damage would you take?<br><br>

You can check that a ghoul is holding no armor by using a trap and checking for approx 24.5 average damage. A ghoul with armor will take less damage and reduce efficiency.

<h3>Monks</h3>
Monks when they work are among the best training monsters since they have strong healing allowing long lasting sessions with easy set up.<br><br>

They heal with an average rate of 6.7 per turn meaning if you want to effectively train shielding your efficiency may be limited capped or risk killing the monk.<br><br>

Monk defences and damage is quite high so you will want to be on defensive mode a good ‘def’ value to reduce damage taken. If you are sword fighting you want to avoid equipping a shield which could decrease your efficiency, so a bright sword (atk 36 def 30) might be ideal.<br><br>


Monk spots are available in Isle of Kings, Maze of Lost Souls, Triangle Tower, Hero Cave, Ghostlands, or as summons.<br><br>

Monks will themselves gain 1 skill each 100, 150, 225, etc hits while they attack (even with no damage) which could drop your efficiency. They will gain 5 skills in the first hour, and gain slowly after that. If you had 140 damage and 94.4% efficiency blocking 2, an additional 5 skills would reduce efficiency to 91.7%. Refresh your monk to reset their skill.<br><br>

</table>

<h3>Summoned Monk - defensive mode</h3>

Summoned monks are on defence mode (see summon page for more detail) which greatly increases their defences and different damage is needed. not for non-pvp as you cant't attack summons!<br><br>

<table>
  <tr><th rowspan="2">Max<br>Damage</th><th rowspan="2">Average<br>Damage</th></th><th colspan="3">Training efficiency (%)<br>while blocking</th></tr>

  <tr><td>180</td><td>5.33</td><td>99.3</td><td>91.5</td><td>80.6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>190</td><td>6.29</td><td>99.6</td><td>93.8</td><td>84.3</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Summoned Monk - shield break</h3>

Many players use weak creatures to break the monks shielding which makes it easier to maximise efficiency and enable multiple players to use a single monk, but can take effort to lure and set up. 40 max damage is probably the limit for a solo knight attacking without killing the monk. Try to pay attention to whether you are regularly getting hits since you might get out of sequence.
Not for non-pvp as you cant attack summons.<br><br>

<h3>Kobolds</h3>

Nice and simple Tibiantis custom mobs with 120 HP and low defences. Some good training spots in Aruthang allow quick respawn that walks to you. They sometimes have armour which will affect these numbers.<br><br>

Max Dam	Av Dam	Mins to kill	% 0	% 1	%2
24	0.28	14.3	85.8	62.3	47.8
					
					
					

<h3>Slimes</h3>

Slimes are a classic training mob, super low defences for high efficiency, replenished automatically, easy to set up, and available all over. They are however slightly overrated since they die so quickly, require a lot of attention and efficiency is lost waiting between slimes. For sword and axe users the minimum atk of 7 is too much, 6 atk crowbars users benefit here. For example with 7 atk, defence mode, and 60 skill you have a max damage of 17, already taking only 3 minutes per kill. At low skill you will take quite a lot of damage from the slimes but with gear and UH this might not be a problem.<br><br>

Always wear a shield as you will always have two slimes on you and it doesn’t affect efficiency.<br><br>

Slimes have decent attack with a max damage of 66. A player with 40 skill, 25 armor (plate set), and a dragon shield 31 def on defence mode will take 1800 damage per hour from two slimes - requiring UHes. A player with a vampire shield, 50 skill, 35 armor on defence mode will take 540 damage per hour from two slimes, which can be healed with natural regeneration.<br><br>

Slimes will increase their skill at a moderate rate. The summons are not relevant since they are killed regularly, but the mother could remain for some time, gaining 11 skill levels over hour to 89 max damage.<br><br>

<h3>Tars</h3>
Tibiantis custom slimes with higher 240HP and higher stats and defences - the slime we all dreamed of?<br><br>

Reverse engineered stats are (roughly) 32 atk, 21 def, 55 skill, 22 arm. In terms of longevity they are a bit like Cyclops, so no golden bullet as you will have to refresh often for good efficiency, but they work better than a slime at higher skill.<br><br>

Their attack is higher than a slime, comparable to a minotaur guard and so not suitable for lower skill levels.<br><br>

<h3>Trolls</h3>
The humble troll. You can train on these straight out of Rookgaard, they come in large numbers close to towns. Their 50 HP is low and defence is worse than a slime so with higher skill the minimum damage becomes too high. They flee on 15 HP so you effectively have only 35 hp to play with unless you trap with parcels. Their low attack means 20 armor is enough to be immune from their attacks, then you can train while 8 boxed on chase mode. Use them to get early skill levels but no further.

*Note fleeing reduces this number

<h3>Minotaurs</h3>
Quite popular but perhaps a bit overrated. Defences and damage are low, they are easy to find in large numbers. They have a high chance to hold extra armor which will drop your efficiency.

<h3>Orc warrior</h3>
Higher hp but higher defence. Chain armors simetimes

<h3>Cyclops</h3>
Cyclops can be found in many different locations and have a high 260HP, low-ish defences and moderate attack. Their defences mean its difficult to get high efficiency with a shield without a short kill time sword users removing their shields would take high damage from the cyclops - with high skill and good armor no shield is workable. Cyclops rarely hold hidden armor. Not recommened as a large scale training monster, but servicable if you are at a cyclops spot anyway.<br><br>

In mount sternum there are a number of spots that are immune from pushing or luring, useful for non-PvP servers.

<h3>Geomancer</h3>
In later versions Geomancers did earth damage which might mislead players to think they are unsuitable, but the Geomancer stone projectile is blocked by shielding and boosts your shield skill so its possible to take minimal damage provided your shielding isn’t broken by 2 monsters.
Easy to get high efficiency since they heal super fast, but you can’t maximise shielding since you need to block the stones.  You will skill shielding with stones 1/3 of the time so in theory shielding will progress at 66% instead of 50%. You wont regen mana but thats not necessarily a problem for knights.

There are a few decent spots to find them like triangle tower, mount sternum, dwarf hell.

<h3>Rotworms</h3>
Classic but only suitable early on - low HP, often have armor

<h3>Elf</h3>
Good 100 HP and very nice low defences. Low attack so can hunt from early on but watch out for arrows 15-35 damage. Many locations to find them.

<h3>Dwarf Guard</h3>
- dont go there, less hp and higher def than cyclops! At least the loot is decent. Steel helm and scale armor will hurt your efficiency.

<h3>Dwarf Soldier</h3>

<h3>Dwarf</h3>

<h3>Gargoyle</h3>

<h3>Amazon</h3>

<h3>Valkyrie</h3>
Huge 190 hp and low defences - one of the best monsters for this ratio. Their spears might break shielding if there are more than 1 so try and take on one at a time. They hold chain armor (10%) or more rarely plate armor, and will run on very low hp. The only place to train on Valkyries is north of Carlin.<br><br>

<h3>Tentacle spawn</h3>
Custom Tibiantis mob that has self healing. Can these be trained on without getting disintegrated by a tentacle horror?

<h3>PvP training</h3>

Requires a friend and pz lock but can potentially be set up nicely since they can have zero shielding and as little armor as needed to keep the minimum damage from the player to a minimum. Characters can (legally) be kept in game while the owner is offline, but they won’t be able to take any actions like eating food etc.

Generally low shielding high armor is best but sometimes a small amount of shielding can result in an overall more consistent defence, making it tricky to optimise. I have run a few case studies to see where the optimal balance lies.

Fist fighting is atk 7, def 5

<h3>Location location location</h3>
Avoiding luring, automatic respawn, close to supplies (bring cascade of hams, mushrooms or bananas cheapskate!), avoiding PK, avoiding PZ, solo vs team, mana investment to set up, close to prefferer hunting spot, avoid pushing (aka isle of kings)<br><br>

Single or zero blockers trainers can use 1sqm channels to be unmovable, and in PvP invinciple provided no monsters can be lured.
