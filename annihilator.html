<h1>Annihilator Quest</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page discusses the Annihilator quest. Due to high damages and combos it is often a matter of luck if you can survive, even if you have enough skill to UH accurately. Damage probrabilities have been calculated and inform chance of death in different scenarios, the effect of items, and to allow comparison of different strategies.<br><br>

<h2>Damage Analysis - set up</h2>
The quest must be completed by 4 Lv100+ players. There are 6 demons, and each of the four players can be hit by up to 3 energy beams.<br><br>

Demons cast fireballs dealing 110-200 fire damage with a chance of 1/3, and energy damage beams of damage 300-420 with a chance of 1/10. Due to CIP code, the 5 demons that are not in melee range will roll the chance to cast every second and the remaining demon every two seconds.<br><br>

The average damage on turn 1 and 2 is therefore 310 + 108 = 418, and 258 + 72 = 330, for an overall average of 374 damage.<br><br>

- Chance of no hit on a single second is 8.53%. This is not shown on the chart.
- Fire damage makes up a 50% or more of the total damage, for most damage values. This is due to it being more likely that two demons cast fire balls (1/9) than 1 energy beam (1/10).
- Demons cast mana drain at an average of 70 and frequency 8 and an average of 12 mana per second per player. This mostly affects mana shield users.
- A lv 100 knight will very rarely be hit in one shot however if they are blocking this is much more likely. Knights are also more succeptible to 2 concequitive high damage seconds but these are still quite rare.
- Mages casting UE take 800 mana,to cast and 750 mana from demons. 1000-1250 average damage with UE for Lv100-150 and you'll take 2 or three for 400-700 mana with SSA. (to be continued).
