<h2>Meet the tean</h2>
<h3>Fire Elemental</h3>
The most expensive summon at 690 mana. These creatures will turn the spamming potential of 7.4 magical creatures against your opponents.

Terrible defences - similar to a dwarf soldier, low HP and the fact they chase their opponents to close range make them vulnerable to melee and expensive to heal in PvE. Most of the stronger creatures have fire immunities, except for perhaps Necromancers and Ancient Scarabs. Even if you did find a way to keep them alive they would tend to steal your exp. Dropping fire fields everywhere will leave you vulnerable to get white skulled.<br>
