<h2>General Summons Guidance</h2>
- Can be used to boost dps, ranged support, blocking, immunity
- How far can you leave them?
- Summon movement when present and not
- Shielding , breaking shielding


<h2>Specific Summons Guidance</h2>
<h3>Fire Elemental</h3>
The most expensive summon at 690 mana.

The main selling point is that theat they are the highest dps summon and turn the spamming potential of 7.4 creature spells to your advantage.

Terrible defences - similar to a dwarf soldier, low HP and the fact they chase their opponents to close range make them vulnerable to melee and expensive to heal in PvE. Most of the stronger creatures have fire immunities, except for perhaps Necromancers and Ancient Scarabs. Even if you did find a way to keep them alive they would tend to steal your exp. Creating fire fields will leave you vulnerable to getting white skulled.<br>
