<h2>General Summons Guidance</h2>
- Can be used to boost dps, ranged support, blocking, immunity
- How far can you leave them?
- Summon movement when present and not
- Shielding , breaking shielding

You can attack the target with a melee weapon to allow a physical or physical ranged attacker to bypass shielding.

<h2>Specific Summons Guidance</h2>
<h3>Fire Elemental</h3>

Fire Elementals (FE) have tbe highest damage output of any summon and turn the spamming potential of 7.4 creature spells to your advantage. They are also the most expensive summon at 690 mana.

They have bad defence - similar to a dwarf soldier and low HP. They chase their targets which leads to them taking additional damage in PvE. Most of the strongest creatures in 7.4 have fire immunities, except for Necromancers and Ancient Scarabs. Blocking FE in with mages while a knight lures can help keep them under control.

FE attacks leave fire fields which can risk you taking a white skull.<br>
  
In PvP they can significantly increase your damage output and overwhelm lower and mid level players. Their ranged explosion attack deals 55-155 fire damage with a frequency of 4 and they throw fire fields with a frequency of 3. Damage is not reduced in PvP. Their relatively low 280 HP is vulnerable to single SD shots from even a lv40 mage. Watch out you don't get caught in the fire.

<h3>Fire Devil</h3>
Similar in many ways to the Fire Elemental but with 'ranged attacker' behaviour so they will keep out of harms way (but will only flee from the monster you target). They cost 530 mana, 200 hp and bad defences.

Their fireball attack does 60-95 damage with a frequency of 9 and a 20-60 damage fire explosion with a frequency of 4. This is less damage than Fire Elementals, but similar.

<h3>Orc Berserker</h3>
The orc berserker takes 590 mana to summon and is the fastest summon with the strongest physical attack - up to 195.

In PvE its rarely seen due to its high cost and weak defences. It has an immunity to poison, which could be useful with scarabs. To optimise their use the mage should run into melee range to block target and allow the second berserker to break shielding.

In PvP Berserkers are both very fast and high damaging, particularly for weakly armoured rune makers, and paladins. Any higher level or prepared opponent will kill them with ease.
