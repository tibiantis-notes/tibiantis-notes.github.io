<h1>Poison & Poison Mechanics</h1>


<h2>Total Poison Damage</h2>

<p>
Total poison damage for periodic poison damage (over time) is calculated differently depending on the source. New poison attacks will replace the remaining damage only if it is higher. For example you cant reduce scorpion poison with a poison field.<br><br>

Several sources like poison fields, vials of  poison deal a fixed damage.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>TotalPoisonDamage = constant</em><br><br>

Player spells such as Envenom and Poison Storm do damage randomly between a min and max strength, proportional to magic power. Magic Power is a function of level and magic level.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>TotalPoisonDamage = random( MinSpellPower, MaxSpellPower ) * MagicPower</em><br><br>


&emsp;<em>MagicPower = max( 1, 
  <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;">
    <span style="display:block; border-bottom:1px solid black;">
      Level * 2 + MagicLevel * 3
    </span>
    <span style="display:block;">100</span>
  </span>
   )
</em><br><br>

Poisoning monsters have a poison stat. Total damage is randomly distributed between 50-100% of this value. For example MonsterPoison of 7 would take a value from 3, 4, ... 7.<br>

&emsp;<em>TotalPoisonDamage = random( roundDown( 
  <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center; font-size: 27px;">
    <span style="display:block; border-bottom:1px solid black;">
      MonsterPoison
    </span>
    <span style="display:block;">2</span>
  </span> ), MonsterPoison )</em><br>


<h2>Periodic Poison Damage</h2>

For periodic poison damage, 5% of remaining damage is used, <strong>rounded up</strong>. The damage dealt is tracked until the total damage is dealt. Damage starts after 4 seconds and at 4 second intervals afterwards. An example of how peroidic damage is calculated is provided in the table below.<br><br>Higher damage poison attacks will last longer than shorter ones, due to the longer tail end; the first half of damage will be dealt in a similar timeframe for poison damages above 100.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>RemainingDamage = TotalPoisonDamage;
</em><br><br>


<em>
&emsp;while ( RemainingDamage > 0 )<br>
&emsp;{<br>
&emsp;&emsp;wait( 4 seconds );<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;PeriodicDamage = roundUp(  <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center; font-size: 27px;">
    <span style="display:block; border-bottom:1px solid black;">
      RemainingDamage
    </span>
    <span style="display:block;">20</span>
  </span> );<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;DealDamage( PeriodicDamage );<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;RemainingDamage = RemainingDamage - PeriodicDamage;<br>
&emsp;}
</em><br><br>


<h2>Table: Example damage from poison field</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Remaining<br>damage</th><th>5% of<br>remaining</th><th>Damage<br>dealt<br></th></tr>
<tr><th>100</th><td>5.00</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><th>95</th><td>4.75</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><th>90</th><td>4.50</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><th>80</th><td>4.00</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><th>76</th><td>3.80</td><td>4</td></tr>

</table><br>

You can calculate the total damage from the first poison hit. This can be used to immediately tell whether a creature will eventually die or not, without having to wait several minutes! The table below highlights some notable monsters weak to poison and minimum poison damage to kill.<br><br>

&emsp;<em>TotalPoisonDamage<sub>min</sub> = 20 * (PeriodicDamage - 1) + 1</em><br><br>

&emsp;<em>TotalPoisonDamage<sub>max</sub> = 20 * PeriodicDamage</em><br><br>

<h2>Table: Initial periodic damage vs total damage</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Periodic<br>damage</th><th>Minimum total<br> damage</th><th>Killable<br>creature</th></tr>
<tr><th>49</th><td>961</td><td>Orc Warlord</td></tr>

<h2>Monster Poison Melee Attacks - Mechanics</h2>

<p>
You have a 100% chance to be poisoned by a damaging hit - shown as a green blood hit. You have a 20% chance to be poisoned by a monster that bypasses your shielding - shown as an armor spark. You will not be poisoned by a monster whose poison melee attack is blocked by shielding - shown as puff of smoke.<br><br>

You can therefore significantly reduce your chance of getting poisoned by equipping a shield and going on defence mode. Using the damage calculator, you can calculate your chances to take a blood hit by default (entering your armor, shielding and skill). You can calculate the chance to bypass shielding by setting armor to zero.

</p>

<h2>Poison Arrows</h2>

<p>
<img src="/images/poison_arrows.PNG" alt="Poison Arrows" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>
Poison arrows inflict poison with a power of 50, which is not very strong. The arrows have 10 attack making very weak but  good(ish) for training. The poison dagger does not inflict poison.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Poison Fields</h2>

<p>
<img src="/images/poison_field.PNG" alt="Poison Field" style="width:256px;height:64px;"><br>
Poison fields do 100 periodic poison damage plus an instant 5 damage for 105 total. Damage cycles start at 5. The fields lasts for 248 seconds (4:08) which is less than the first two stages of a fire field. Fields can be removed with destroy field, which works at a distance. Magic Wall or wild growth will not remove fields (TBC).
</p>

<h2>Poison Field</h2>

<p>
<img src="/images/poison_field_rune.PNG" alt="Poison field rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>
Mana: 50<br>
Type: Rune<br>
Charges: 3<br>
Mana per charge: 17<br><br>

This is quite good in terms of damage per mana for early characters but also fairly impractical. Minotaurs and minotaur archers are killed in one shot so you could charge around as a low level mage killing all in one hit and then collecting loot on second round.  

This rune makes the caster vulnerable to other players giving you a white skill. After 5 seconds (TBC) you will be safe from white skull. This is the cheapest option to inflict poison on a warlord and mitigate its invisibility casting.

</p>
<h2>Poison Bomb</h2>
<img src="/images/poison_bomb_rune.PNG" alt="Poison Bomb Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Mana: 130<br>
Type: Rune<br>
Charges: 2<br>
Mana per charge: 65<br><br>
Poison bomb is useful in PvP as an easy way to spread fields that can prevent players being pushed, or cover obstacles or using rope spots. The spell is generally less useful than fire bomb due to lower tread damage of 5, and shorter duration.

<h2>Poison Wall</h2>
<img src="/images/poison_wall_rune.PNG" alt="Poison Wall Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>
Mana: 160<br>
Type: Rune<br>
Charges: 4<br>
Mana per charge: 40<br><br>
Cheapest way to create a field wall however few strong monsters are weak to poison except for orc warlords and orc leaders that could even filter berserkers from warlords. Poison walls or poison field can be used to trap summoned fire elementals or fire devils - granting greater damage output and control.

<h2>Envenom</h2>
<img src="/images/envenom_rune.PNG" alt="Envenom Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Mana: 100<br>
Type: Rune<br>
Charges: 3<br>
Mana per charge: 33<br>
Min/Max Power: 50-90<br>
Average Power: 70<br><br>

Evenvom is rarely used in 7.4, its damage per mana is slightly better than HMM, and power is more than double but damage is dealt extremely slowly.<br><br>

This extra power may be useful for one hit killing creatures like cyclops, from the earlier table you can tell if you have rolled high enough to kill, if not you can cast an extra spell. This method would require either not looting or waiting the second lap. Another downside is that in the time it takes poison to kill a mon you might reduce its respawn a bit.

<h2>Poison Storm</h2>

Mana: 600 (Tibiantis: 400)<br>
Type: Instant<br>
Min/Max Power: 150-250<br>
Average Power: 200<br><br>

Deals poison damage over a range greater range than UE - the greatest of any player area spell. There are few uses for this spell except for novelty. You will overspill damage on most weaker monsters and stronger monsters are immune. Fire elementals are, surprisingly, not immune so poison storm can be used to clear the few rooms with large numbers of them.<br><br>

In PvP most players will just cast antidote leaving this spell little more than a nuisance. PvP damage is not halved for poison spells so Poison Storm is ironically the highest damaging PvP spell in the game.<br><br>
If you run about gathering as many monsters as possible to get the maximum effect of this spell they will still be alive after you cast and so getting out can be annoying.<br><br>
A level 200 druid with magic level 80 will cause up to 1600 damage, start at 80 damage and last 117 cycles (7.8 minutes). Almost half the damage is dealt in the first minute.

<h2>Antidote</h2>
<img src="/images/magic_spark.PNG" alt="Antidote Spell" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Mana: 30<br>
Type: Instant<br>
Effect: Cures poison<br><br>

The infamous exana pox spell is an early must have spell for any character, if only to prevent a slow and painful death from the occasional scorpion.<br><br>
At higher levels healing power becomes quite significant and its not always efficient to use exana pox. For example a UH rune is as efficient as mana potions + exana pox after poison fields.

<h2>Antidote rune</h2>
<img src="/images/antidote_rune.PNG" alt="Antidote Rune" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>

Mana: 50<br>
Type: Rune<br>
Charges: 1<br>
Effect: Cures poison<br><br>

Adana Pox, one of the most useless spells. Expensive and you would be better served bringing mana fluids and casting exana pox. It has the unique ability of heal another player or summon of poison. Temple NPCs can also heal poison.

<h2>Poison Damage Reduction</h2>

The main way of reducing poison damage is by using a silver amulet, which reduces damage by 10% rounded up for 200 charges. The reduced damage is then rounded down, for example 3 damage would become 2.7 and then rounded down to 2.<br>This rounding magnifies the percent reduction;  small 1 damage poisons from larvas or snakes are reduced by 100%, stronger poison like scorpion poison is reduced by more than 25% which could save your life from a scorpion PK.<br><br>Elven amulets and might rings also reduce poison damage but it would be a waste to use them. You might be able to waste an opponents charges in PvP.

<h2>Poisonous monsters</h2>

Poisoning monsters are listed below. Several monsters, such as Scarabs and Necromancers deal an instant poison attack or create poison fields - these are not detailed.

<h3>Scorpion</h3>
<img src="/images/scorpion.PNG" alt="Scorpion" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>
The most iconic poisoner punching far above its weight with a poison power of 350. In compensation this creature has great xp for its health.<br><br>There are various strategies, outside of ranged attacks, to minimise damage from these annoying creatures which apply to other lesser poisoners too.

<ol>
<li>Dont let get your shielding get broken. This will allow the third mob to bypass shielding and get an armor ping or blood hit.
<li>Similarly wear decent shield on defence mode. For knights will not slow down killing speed.
<li>Let them hit you first before attacking on full attack - this will keep you on defence mode.
<li>Better yet - attack them first. Running up to them will normally give an even chance for scorpion to hit first as whoever moves towards the other will hit first. By using a diagonal step you can move two tiles at once and be guaranteed to hit first.
<li>Weaken with a trap. This roughly halves their HP making more likely to kill in one hit. In this manner (and above strategies) mages can reliably kill scorpions with melee weapons without getting poisoned.
</ol>
Summoned scorpions can be used to kill in PvP without taking a frag. The target should take poison from the scorpion, then kill the scorpion and atleast 60 seconds must pass before the target dies. This could also be done by a player but they would have to suicide.

<h3>Ancient Scarab</h3>
<img src="/images/ancient_scarab.PNG" alt="Ancient Scarab" style="width:128px;height:128px;"><br>
Ancient scarabs possess one of the most potent poison spells of any monster the game at 400-500 (20 to 25 for the initial cycle) for their area spell.<br><br>
One benefit is that with multiple scarabs, the damage does not stack. If you stay at range you should be able to avoid the poison. High level players 100+ may start to find that UH is as cost effective as exana pox.


<h2>Slime (liquid)</h2>
<img src="/images/vial_of_slime.PNG" alt="Vial of Slime" style="width:64px;height:64px;"><br>
A vial of slime when drunk will poison you for 200 damage. This liquid can be collected from many corpses, swamp terrain, etc.
