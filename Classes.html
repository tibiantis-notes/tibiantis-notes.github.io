<h2>Class Overviews</h2>
This section will give an overveiw of the different classes and their relative merits.<br><br>

<h3>Knight</h3>
The knight is the most chill and most profitable class to pick, click mobs and collect loot.<br><br>

The early game is often dominated by training, which is fairly straightforward for knights who will typically train to skill 75-85 before levelling in earnest. There is a view that at higher levels, afk training is too risky and so training becomes less convenient. Skilling adds to attack and defence and is reccomeneded until atleast Magic Level 4 is reached for UH access, which is very powerful even at low levels. <br><br>

With mid level skills knights are somewhat limited to weaker mobs their hunting choices since many creatures do too much damage or have too high shielding. Nonetheless cyclops and dwarf guards and similar mobs can be good experience and great profit, and there are many places to hunt. After the parcel quest a knight can hunt for many hours between resupply.<br><br>

On the road to Level 100 knights may afford an SoV or MMS which will significantly boost their defences and modestly boost attack. This reduces UH burn while hunting making them more profitable.
<br>br>

In PvP knight damage is typically terrible while their survivability is very high making them get targetted less. They can do decent damage against much weaker opponents who have poor armor or no shield, and in late game runes, exori and ice rapiers can help somewhat. They do best in a war of attrition but this typically would take long enough for help to arrive. They lack instant healing so are vulnerable to paralysis.<br><br>

<h3>Paladin</h3>

The paladin is a versatile class that can progress quickly from the start, thanks to their immediate access to their endgame weapon - the crossbow.<br><br>
  
The combination of bolts piercing monster shielding, avoiding taking damage, and double speed skill progression significantly reduces the need for Paladins to train distance fighting. It is difficult to train with spears as they need to be picked up and do a lot of damage.<br><br>

In the mid game they have great damage and can boost with runes where needed. Giant Spiders in the Plains of Havoc are just one example of where their ranged damage shines when paired with speed. They are easily the best class to roam with as they can offensively and defensively handle most scenarios. <br><br>

In the late game they remain strong with bolts getting an advantage against higher shielding monsters like dragon lords, but knights catch up somewhat through their anni weapon, skill development, level scaled magic and ease of hunting. Paladin HMM + bolts will beat Mage HMM at any level, particularly notable when reaching Lv100 is much easier on Paladins. Around level 100 burst arrows match bolts in damage but they aren't worth it for some time after this. <br><br>

In PvP Paladins enjoy access to SDs and consistent damage from bolts making them a threat in short and long fights, paricularly against slower opponents. Later on they still have decent damage and survivability with Exura Vita and SD. If forced into close quarters against knights they will either take high damage from weapons or need to forego xbow damage.<br><br>

<ul>
<li> Lag and latency can make it difficult to effectively kite damage.
<li> Bolts cost money, capacity and can limit hunts without forward planning.
<li> Spear and shielding is a great alternative combination. Spears do high damage and never break so even a few can help where you don't have space or run out of bolts.
<li> Decent magic level progression.
<li> Good mana regeneration and lower demands on mana while hunting. Can make runes when hunting and outside of hunts.
<li> The best healing of any class.
<li> Access to SD and magic wall.
<li> Can't use torches with xbow.
</ul>


<h3>Sorcerer and Druid</h3>
In 7.4 Mages (Sorcerers and Druids) fit the stereotype of squishy and useless at lower levels and gods at higher levels.<br>

In terms of economy Mages are by far the worst, usually needing financial support from a knight character, credit card or extensive rune farming scheme. By the time their power is high enough to break even on hunts they will usually want to be hunting something stronger and end up wasting even more. It could be said that the combination of lower profit and experience (for magic power) for a self funded mage means that Paladins and Knights can make better mages.<br><br>

There are no functional wands or rods in 7.4  so mages rely on melee damage, classically rotworms and larvae with a warhammer. There are ways to hunt to get more profit and xp.<br><br>

In terms of power Mages benefit from the 7.4 mana system where damage is high with no cooldown and some spell costs are low. With a full mana pool there is lots a mage can do.<br><br>

In the mid to late game Mages start to benefit greatly from burst arrows which allow them to double dip on their magic power each turn and have enough magic power to overcome damage reductions from monster armor.<br><br>

For most late game mages hunting expense is less of a concern so they can enjoy unrivalled damage output and exp potential.<br><br>

In PvP mages are the ultimate offensive shooter with some defensive utility. The expense of Sudden Death makes burst arrows easily justified matching or exceeding paladin damage from an early stage. UE in particular can make devastating combos. Strong haste is very powerful to allow you to engage or disengage quickly, or simply run around the map until your pz is over.<br><br>

<h3>Sorcerer vs Druid</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerers get access to powerful instant spells in Ultimate Explosion and Energy Wave. Druids get access to Poison Storm, Heal Friend, Mass Healing and Paralyze.
<li>Heal Friend has minimal advantage over UH even after the custom buff in terms of economy. Knights often heal themselves in team hunts to allow mages to throw runes. It is nice to not need to aim. Mass Healing can help with summons but the effect can often be achieved with runes. Paralyze can be very strong but is difficult and situational to use.
<li>A few custom spells like Extinguish and Desintegrate, help druids defensively in PvP but are niche. UE as an instant spell can be useful in clearing traps (such as boat traps) or traps that prevent you using runes.
<li>Runes can be traded and so are not unique to either class. UH tends to have a higher sell price.
<li>The consensus is that Sorcerers are superior to druids.
<li>Free account druids can use paralyze runes, and sorcerers can use energy wave.
<li>Summons can have some utility in the mid game, but are much more expensive than in later versions.
<li>The various utility and roleplaying spells, and the ability to make most runes on the go are a nice touch for mages.
<li>Druids get better melee skill development (1.8x) compared to Sorcerers (2.0x). This results in a 1 or 2 skill advantage. Shielding is the same for both.
<li> The passive income from manasitting is about 1.2k/hr.
</ul>
