<li> Traps can be bought in Edron for 280gp a piece. They do a fixed 30 damage, reduced by armour.</li>
<li> You put them on the ground and right click to set (open). If a monster walks over it, it will do damage. If you walk over it, it will close and do no damage. If it is set under a player or monster it will stay open.</li>
<li> The easiest way to use is to place and open a trap under your character with a monster adjacent, then take a step away in the opposite direction. The monster will follow and step on the trap. Then drag the trap back under the character and repeat quickly.</li>
<li> The speed between hits depends on monster, terrain, etc but can be less than every 2 seconds.</li>
<li> Although underused in 7.4 era, they have a great potential to add DPS.</li>
<li> Monster armour can greatly reduce trap damage which leads to their being inneffective against 25+ armour opponents.</li>
<li> You will get zero experience if you only deal trap damage. You will gain full experience if you do any other damage - so one light magic missile shot would be sufficient to get full experience. Mages can dispatch minotaur guards and similar monsters in this way.</li>
<li> The table below provides trap average damage vs armour.</li>
