<li>Traps can be bought in Edron for 280gp a piece, and weighs a modest 21oz. They deal a fixed 30 damage, reduced by armor.</li>
<li>To use traps sinoly place them on the ground and right click to set (open). If a monster or player walks on or is pushed onto a trap, it will close, dealing damage to monsters but not players. If a player or monster is already on a trap before it was set or subsequently walks off it will stay open.</li>
<li>The easiest way to use is to place and open a trap under your character with a monster adjacent, then take a step away in the opposite direction. The monster will follow and step on the trap. Then drag the trap back under the character and repeat quickly.</li>
<li>The rate that a monster can be hit can be every 2 seconds or less.</li>
<li>Although underused in 7.4 era, they have a good potential to increase your damage output.</li>
<li>Monster armor can greatly reduce trap damage which leads to their being inneffective against 25+ armour opponents.</li>
<li>To gain full experience from the monster killed with traps you will need to deal 1 or more damage from another source like physical attack or spell. For example a mage can kill a minotaur guard with one light magic missile shot, traps and get full experience.</li>
<li>Multiple traps can be used, with the more ambitous using 8 in a square around an obstacle to deal continuous damage while staying out of range.</li>
